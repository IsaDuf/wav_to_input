wav_to_input
=======================================
Preprocessing library to create preprocessed datasets from audio datasets

## Description

wav_to_input is a pre-processing pipeline to transform raw audio datasets to h5 datasets containing the desired representation for input (e.g. spectograms, mel-spectogragms, cqt, chroma). This can be used to save computational time when processing audio on the fly for a given articheture is not required.

Most of the dsp is built on the librosa library.
